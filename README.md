# ReadSON

Goal of this project is to develop a fast CLI utility tool that quickly allows to convert a large amount of complex *JSON* files into *markdown*, according to a template. This is particularly useful for use in knowledge base systems where users have a lot of structred data they want to turn into *readable* text.
